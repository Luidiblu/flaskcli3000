Ever get an idea and it seems like a good idea in the moment, but eventually, you come to realize that it's a bad idea... But you've already sunk so much time into it that you have to follow through? Welcome to the flaskcli3000 (rhetorical)

Are you tired of your alcoholism being boring and manageable and shit? Well boy have I got the product for youuuuuu (rhetorical)

Diego, I hear you ask, how do I use this garbage? (not rhetorical)

Well nosy little shit, just follow the steps:
*reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee*
```
python3 setup.py install
```
and...
*reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee*
(add this to `.bashrc` file or your life will be more random than particle spin and quantum mechanics)
```
alias flaskcli3000='python3 path/to/hell/main.py'
```
and done!!!

`flaskcli3000`

it's kind of like alcoholism but less productive
