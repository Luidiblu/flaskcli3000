Ever get an idea and it seems like a good idea in the moment, but eventually, you come to realize that it's a bad idea... But you've already sunk so much time into it that you have to follow through? 


Welcome to the **flaskcli3000** ðŸ˜„


This CLI is a toll for generate Flask API's.

# Setup

First, you need to install this tool:

```sh
python3 setup.py install
```

(optional)
Now, if you want, you can add the tool your .bashrc or .zshrc file.

```sh
alias flaskcli3000='python3 path/to/hell/main.py'
```

And now, to call this tool, you just need to type:

```sh
flaskcli3000
```

it's kind of like alcoholism but more productive
